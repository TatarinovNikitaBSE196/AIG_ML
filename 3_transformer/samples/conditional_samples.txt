======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
 Precc, properly, is a C library for automating
   computations and parsing programming. It makes use of the concept of automaton to its
   basic point, and the C stack being dynamically available as token in the event

 Precc is a set of
   modularity tests, one per line, to ensure a good representation of a concept.
   Of particular concern to the Procc team is the correctness of the

 Precc is a set of
   natural language specifications for encryption and decoding of
   data. The library is being maintained by the Tor Project, and
   been a community effort by volunteers seeking to understand the philosophical
