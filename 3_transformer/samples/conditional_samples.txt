======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
 Precc, properly, is a C library for automating
   computations and parsing programming. It makes use of the concept of automaton to its
   basic point, and the C stack being dynamically available as token in the event

 Precc is a set of

 Precc is a set of

 It may be referred to as 'accidental' compilation since it is usually

======================================== SAMPLE 14 ========================================
 Shift/reduce reports are much more confusing to maintenance practitioners because they assign no value to the arbitrary p(n) reconstruction arithmetic model in which the
